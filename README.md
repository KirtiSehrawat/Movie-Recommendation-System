This is a simple movie recommendation system which is based on Content-Based Recommendation System.
Content-based filtering is one of the popular techniques of recommendation or recommender systems. The content or attributes of the things one likes are referred to as "content." Here, the system uses ones features and likes in order to recommend one with things that one might like.

When the similar movies are to be searched based on the contents of the input movie, the web application provides a list of the recommended movies using Machine Learning(ML).
If the input movie name is misspelled or not present in the database, it gives an error and provides an option to revisit the home page.
